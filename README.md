# GeNT
Genealogical Numbering Toolkit... or Toolset or Toolbar or something like that... :^)

## Description
GeNT is (planned to be) a LibreOffice Writer extension providing tools to facilitate writing and editing numbered genealogies using the [NGSQ numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#NGSQ_System).

There's obviously not much here yet.
